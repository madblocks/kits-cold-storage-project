# About Project
A cold storage unit incorporates a refrigeration system to maintain the desired room environment for the commodities to be stored. An IoT emulated environment has to be integrated to make the entire storage smart. Sensor Networks incorporated across the storage collect, store, process the data and gives a smart notifications to the user and customer. <br/>

<br/>
The team from <b>KKR & KSR Institute of Technology and Science, Guntur </b> came forward to create a smart and intelligent system for cold storages. This git is officially maintained by the team from KITS Guntur.
